# 🎨✨ Image Style Transfer

## 📌 Overview
Image Style Transfer is a fascinating and challenging problem in computer vision. This project leverages **deep learning** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to generate high-quality stylized images by transferring the artistic style of a reference artwork onto a target content image.

---

## 🖼️ Background & Importance

- 🎨 **Image style transfer** enables artistic transformations by blending the content of one image with the style of another.
- 📚 Traditional methods rely on low-level image features and struggle with separating semantic content from artistic style.
- 🤖 Deep learning offers a powerful and flexible solution, making high-quality artistic transformations possible.

## 📝 Problem Statement

> 🔍 Traditional texture transfer techniques are limited by their dependence on basic image features (like edges, colors, and gradients).  
The core challenge lies in **effectively separating semantic content from artistic style** to enable visually coherent and aesthetically pleasing stylizations.

**✅ Deep learning-based techniques, particularly using CNNs, address this by capturing hierarchical image representations.**
